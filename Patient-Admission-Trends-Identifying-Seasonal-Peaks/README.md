# Patient-Admission-Trends-Identifying-Seasonal-Peaks
Investigating fluctuations in hospital admissions based on time of year, disease types, and age groups.


Abstract :
      Hospital admissions fluctuate due to seasonal variations, disease outbreaks, and demographic factors, impacting resource planning and patient care. This project leverages Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze historical hospital admission data, detect seasonal trends, and provide actionable insights for healthcare management.
The project begins with data preprocessing, where missing values in critical fields like age and admission date are handled using Pandas and NumPy. A synthetic dataset is generated, incorporating disease types, seasonal peaks, and patient age groups. Using time-based analysis, trends in hospital admissions are examined to identify peak periods, leveraging Pandas' time series functions for statistical summarization and anomaly detection.
For a deeper understanding of admission patterns, statistical summarization is performed using NumPy and SciPy, calculating department-wise admission rates and disease-wise trends. Data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly helps in interpreting seasonal variations, disease-based admissions, and demographic distributions through interactive charts.
Further, pattern detection is applied using clustering techniques such as K-Means and DBSCAN from Scikit-learn, grouping similar disease patterns and identifying high-risk periods. Predictive analytics with time series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet) helps in estimating future admission trends, assisting hospitals in proactive decision-making.
By integrating Python’s data science and machine learning capabilities, this project provides valuable insights into hospital admission trends, enabling healthcare institutions to optimize staff allocation, resource management, and preparedness for peak admission periods, ultimately improving patient care and operational efficiency.
